Greebles
========

A modern port of a classic arcade game!

	docs - Original manual, specifications, notes, etc.

Greebles was a computer game originally developed by Peter N. Lewis at Stairways Software. It is sadly no longer supported. From their website:

	The program Greebles is not currently supported. You can get a copy of the last version from our Archive site.

	We have no current plans to develop this program further, however it is my desire to update it for Mac OS X one day. This may or may not ever happen.

	Greebles requires a serial number, but you can no longer purchase these serial numbers. So if you need a serial number, please email me and I will give you some.

One fan site has survived: http://www.infam.ch/greebles/

In 2007, I contacted Peter and, explaining that I was just a hobbyist developer, asked for permission to attempt to recreate Greebles for Windows. 
He gave me the go ahead and emailed me the game assets that he still had.
